                            Iterative Waterfall Model is the extension of the Classical Waterfall model. 
                            In a practical software development work, it is not possible to strictly follow the classical waterfall model. 
                            In this context, we can view the Iterative waterfall model as making necessary changes to the classical waterfall 
                            model to make it usable in practical software development projects. This model is almost same as the classical waterfall 
                            model except some changes are made to improve the performance of the software development. The iterative waterfall model provides 
                            feedback paths from every phase to its previous phases, which is the main difference from the classical waterfall model. 
                            When errors are detected at some later phase, these feedback paths allow correcting errors committed by programmers during some phase. 
                            The feedback path allows the phase to be reworked in which errors are committed and these changes are reflected in the later phases. 
                            There is no feedback path provided for feasibility study phase, so if any change is required in this phase then iterative model doesn't 
                            have scope for modification or making corrections. Feedback paths introduced by the iterative waterfall model are shown in the figure below.

                            Software Life Cycle Models in Software Engineering

                            A software life cycle model (also termed process model) is a pictorial and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. 
                            It describes the different activities that need to be carried out to develop a software product and the sequencing of these activities. 
                            A life cycle model graphically represents the different phases of a life cycle and their ordering accompanied by with textual description. 
                            Additionally, it may represent the various types of the activities carried out during a phase and the documents produced. We can therefore, 
                            define a life cycle model as follows: A software life cycle model is a descriptive and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. 
                            In other words, a life cycle model maps the various activities performed on a software product from its inception to retirement. Different life 
                            cycle models may map the necessary development activities to phases in different ways. Thus, no matter which life cycle model is followed, 
                            the essential activities are included in all life cycle models though the action may be carried out in distinct orders in different life cycle models.

                            A well-defined life cycle model helps to produce good quality products. A good software engineer should have enough knowledge on how to choose the SDLC model 
                            based on the project context and the business requirements. It may be required to choose the right SDLC model according to the specific concerns and requirements 
                            of the project to ensure its success. The development team must determine a suitable life cycle model for a particular plan and then observe to it. The primary benefit of 
                            using a life cycle model is that it helps to developed a software in a systematic and disciplined manner When a team is developing a software product, there must be a clear 
                            understanding among team representative about when and what to do. Otherwise, it would point to chaos and project failure. SDLC models might have a different approach but the 
                            basic phases and activity remain the same for all the models. A number of different SDLC models are used today to guide professionals through their project-based work.
